                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        Yes! This is an open-source educational project developed for learning purposes. 
                        The platform itself is free to use. However, if you connect real exchange accounts 
                        and execute live trades, you'll need to manage your own funds and may incur 
                        exchange fees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Recommended:</strong> Use testnet/sandbox accounts provided by exchanges 
                        like Binance, Bybit, and OKX to practice without risking real money.

                    <p>
                        The platform uses the CCXT library to support multiple exchanges:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Binance</strong> - World's largest exchange (testnet available ✅)</li>

                        <li><strong>OKX</strong> - Major global exchange (testnet available ✅)</li>
                        <li><strong>MEXC</strong> - Wide selection of altcoins</li>
                        <li><strong>BingX</strong> - Copy trading platform</li>

                    <p>
                        We strongly recommend using <strong>testnet accounts</strong> for learning 
                        and testing. Testnet provides the same API functionality with fake money, 
                        eliminating financial risk.

                <summary>How does AI prediction work?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        The platform uses two complementary prediction methods:
                    </p>
                    <h4>1. Indicator-Based Prediction (Rule-Based)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyzes RSI (Relative Strength Index)</li>
                        <li>Checks MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</li>
                        <li>Evaluates EMA alignment (9, 20, 50, 100, 200)</li>
                        <li>Assesses Bollinger Bands position</li>
                        <li>Considers volume trends</li>
                        <li>Combines scores into BUY/SELL/HOLD signal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>2. AI Model Prediction (Machine Learning)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Uses scikit-learn RandomForest algorithms</li>
                        <li>Trained on historical OHLCV data and computed indicators</li>
                        <li>Predicts direction (up/down) and magnitude (price change %)</li>
                        <li>Provides confidence scores</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Both methods are educational demonstrations. 
                        Real-world trading requires more sophisticated models, risk management, 
                        and continuous monitoring.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">
                        ⚠️ Prediction accuracy varies significantly and should NOT be relied upon for real trading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Factors affecting accuracy:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Market conditions (trending vs. ranging)</li>
                        <li>Data quality and freshness</li>
                        <li>Model training data size</li>
                        <li>Sudden news events or black swan events</li>
                        <li>Low liquidity or manipulation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The AI models are trained on limited historical data and use simplified 
                        features. Professional trading systems use far more sophisticated approaches, 
                        including sentiment analysis, order flow, macro indicators, and ensemble models.

                <summary>What are EMA signals and Golden/Death crosses?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>EMA (Exponential Moving Average)</strong> is a trend-following indicator 
                        that gives more weight to recent prices.
                    </p>
                    <h4>📈 Golden Cross (Bullish)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Occurs when a faster EMA (e.g., EMA 50) crosses <strong>above</strong> a slower 
                        EMA (e.g., EMA 200). This is traditionally interpreted as a bullish signal, 
                        suggesting an uptrend may be beginning.
                    </p>
                    <h4>📉 Death Cross (Bearish)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Occurs when a faster EMA crosses <strong>below</strong> a slower EMA. 
                        This is traditionally interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting a downtrend 
                        may be starting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Important:</strong> These are lagging indicators and not always reliable. 
                        They work best in trending markets but can produce false signals in ranging markets.

                <summary>What is a Grid Trading Bot?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        A Grid Bot creates multiple buy and sell orders at predefined price levels 
                        within a specified range. It profits from price volatility by repeatedly 
                        buying low and selling high as the price oscillates.
                    </p>
                    <h4>When to Use:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ Sideways/ranging markets with clear support and resistance</li>
                        <li>✅ Low-volatility assets moving within a predictable range</li>
                        <li>✅ When you expect price to stay within bounds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>When NOT to Use:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>❌ Strong trending markets (up or down)</li>
                        <li>❌ High-volatility assets that can break out of range</li>
                        <li>❌ Low-liquidity pairs with large spreads</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Tip:</strong> The platform's EMA signals can help identify when the 
                        market is sideways (best for Grid) vs. trending (best for DCA).

                <summary>What is a DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) Bot?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        DCA is an investment strategy where you buy (or sell) a fixed amount at regular 
                        intervals or when price drops by a certain percentage. This smooths out market 
                        volatility and reduces the risk of buying at the peak.
                    </p>
                    <h4>When to Use DCA BUY Bots:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ During downtrends to accumulate at lower prices</li>
                        <li>✅ When you believe the asset will recover long-term</li>
                        <li>✅ To build a position gradually without timing the market</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>When to Use DCA SELL Bots:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ During uptrends to take profits gradually</li>
                        <li>✅ To exit a position without selling everything at once</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Risk Warning:</h4>
                    <p style="color: #ef4444;">
                        DCA does NOT guarantee profit. In a continuously falling market (e.g., a project 
                        going to zero), you will accumulate losses. Always use stop-loss limits and 
                        only invest in fundamentally sound assets.

                    </ul>
                    <h4>DCA Bots:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>BUY bots only execute during uptrends or Golden Cross</li>
                        <li>SELL bots only execute during downtrends or Death Cross</li>

                        Testnet (or sandbox) is a replica of the exchange's production environment 
                        that uses <strong>fake money</strong>. It has the same API, same features, 
                        but zero financial risk.

                    <h4>Testnet Resources:</h4>

                <summary>Why are my predictions showing "Not enough data"?</summary>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>
                        This error occurs when there isn't sufficient historical price data in the 
                        database to calculate indicators like EMA 200 (which requires at least 200 candles).
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to Fix:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click the <strong>"🔄 Sync Price History Now"</strong> button in the error banner</li>
                        <li>Wait for the system to fetch historical data from the exchange</li>
                        <li>Refresh the page</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The system automatically syncs price data every 2 hours, but you can trigger 
                        it manually anytime.
